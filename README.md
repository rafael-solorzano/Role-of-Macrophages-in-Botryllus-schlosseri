# Elucidating the Role of Macrophages during Key Biological Processes in *Botryllus schlosseri*

## Abstract

&emsp;&emsp;Our model organism, Botryllus schlosseri, is a small, asexual filter feeder that lives in the ocean. A fascinating facet of the animal is its 7-day blastogenetic cycle, which includes the process of vascular regression. While phagocytes play a dynamic role in the reproductive cycle, it is not well known how phagocytes participate in vascular regression. To investigate this, we induced vascular regression in Botryllus (during stages that the animal was not focusing too much energy on reproducing), and then track fluorescently-labeled phagocyte population dynamics over time. Preliminary results point towards a positive correlation between phagocytes and vascular regression. This validates the project and allows us to invest more energy into investigating the role of phagocytes during vascular regression â€“ an area of research that can become the nucleation site for further studies into vascular regression, the lesser studied process in vascular biology.
